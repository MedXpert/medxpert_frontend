# MedXpert
MedXpert is an online mobile and web-based system mainly intended to increase and improve access to health facilities.
## Abstract
Getting fast medical attention when one needs is clearly very important, and things like emergency lines, ambulances, and denser health facilities have been used to that end, but while Ethiopia might have and be in the process of implementing those, there has been no exploitation of what ICT could give in closing the gap between those that need medical attention and the health facilities. The prevailing way of getting medical services is to go to a health facility one knows or is told of and make an appointment. And when one needs immediate medical attention one could call an ambulance which could be very far or not the best choice, assuming either the person in danger is conscious and can call, or there is someone else who can. This means that the medical attention given could be inefficient, slow, and, in places where the involved are new to the place, unreliable, and potentially requires outside help. To better this and combat its problems, we propose a digital system that makes appointments faster and efficient and addresses health emergency cases more reliably. The system will allow people to view health facilities, and make appointments. It will show the facilities with their relevant details, enabling people to choose one that has what they need and is also close. In cases of emergencies, it will allow people to launch an emergency sequence they have set up that will get them medical attention and/or some help. Furthermore, it will detect if a person's phone is falling – which could indicate that the person may have a heart attack, seizure, etc. – and if the user is unresponsive, it will launch an emergency sequence (of the likes described above). This would especially help those with health conditions predisposing them to such emergencies.
